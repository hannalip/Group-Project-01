# What do you want to eat?
By Hannali Patidar, Young Pak, Zoey Frakes,and Zedekia Malwawi

### UPENN-PHI- Jan 13, Project 1

### Overview 
You come home from a long day of work. Your partner or roommate asks ' what you would like to eat? No one wants to be the one to decide and you yourself are indecisive.  The other person is getting HANGRY  and someone needs to decide now. You go to What Do You Want ?!? 

What Do You Want?!? Is an application that answers the million dollar question "What do you want to eat?" for the everyday indecisive person. The idea of the application was to incorporate actual real time, cuisine and price points to effectively make an executive decision on a person's food selection. The app will display questions for the user to answer from a selection of choices and then submit.
The checked off selections will run through our APIs to curate a list of restaurants and places to get food.
You can then click into the places suggest and view the menu.


## Technologies and Languages Used
* Google Maps API
* Restaurant Menus API
* CSS
* Javascript
* Foundations
* Ulkit
* Jquery
* AJAX
* JSON

### User Story Completed

* As a User I should be able to answer prompts in order for the app to make a conclusive suggestion.

* As a user I should be able to choose from 5 selections given by the application.

* As a user I should be able to look at menus from local restaurants.

### 503 Error   
Things to note: Our API crashed 4 days prior to the application due date. Due to the server no longer being available; we did find a work around where we were able to save the results in a js file based on the latest results. While we are limited to our results, we are still able to produce an application. For the future we will note APIs and their strengths and weaknesses. Do not solely rely on Rapid API.
