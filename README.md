# What do you want to eat?
By Hannali Patidar, Young Pak, Zoey Frakes,and Zedekia Malwawi

### UPENN-PHI- Jan 13, Project 1

### Overview 
You come home from a long day of work. Your partner or roommate asks ' what you would like to eat? No one wants to be the one to decide and you yourself are indecisive.  The other person is getting HANGRY  and someone needs to decide now. You go to What Do You Want ?!? 

What Do You Want?!? Is an application that answers the million dollar question "What do you want to eat?" for the everyday indecisive person. The idea of the application was to incorporate actual real time, cuisine and price points to effectively make an executive decision on a person's food selection. The app will display questions for the user to answer from a selection of choices and then submit.
The checked off selections will run through our APIs to curate a list of restaurants and places to get food.
You can then click into the places suggest and view the menu.
